1009	Musical Scales	It turns out that scales arise from some simple mathematical rules about when notes sound harmonious together. This class will show you how the Western musical scale arises from those rules, and how with some different choices we could have ended up with 5, 19, 22, or even 53 notes. You'll hear what music sounds like on unfamiliar scales, and even get the opportunity to play a piano keyboard with 19 notes in each octave.	40	103

1013	So I can solve a Rubik's Cube, now what?!	This is a class intended for people who can solve a Rubik's Cube and want to move on to more advanced puzzles. I will teach you how to solve the 4x4, 5x5, ... ,nxn cubes, as well as the Megaminx and Square-1. I will also go over the speedcuber's method for solving a normal Rubik's Cube. In addition, I will teach you how you would go about solving the Cube blindfolded. If there's time, I'll try and go over the 4-Dimensional and 5-Dimensional analogs of a Rubik's Cube as well.	30	103
1014	How to feed 15 people under 30 dollars	Food brings people together. Sometimes, that's a lot of people. And they're hungry. We'll teach you how to cook up enough food (for food preferences we'll go with vegetarian) to feed a room full of people--from getting cheap ingredients (we'll do this ourselves, but it's still good to know!) to scaling recipes to actually dicing and slicing and frying and boiling. Time to get cooking!	15	103
1015	Winning a Losing Game: Interactive Thermo-Fluid Dynamics	Ever been curious about how engines work?  How the power you use in your home is generated?  If you have, then this is the class for you!  We're taking an interactive approach to the often-feared subjects of thermal and fluid dynamics.  You'll get an introduction to energy, entropy, the laws of thermodynamics, and basic fluid dynamics.  We'll culminate the course with connections to electricity generation, jet engines, and other awesome applications.	25	103
1016	Learn to Play Go	Go, also known as Weiqi in Chinese and Baduk in Korean, is a game that originated in China about five thousand years ago. Two players, black and white, take turns placing a stone on a 19 by 19 board. The objective is to control a larger territory than the opponent. The rules are so simple, yet from simplicity comes endless complexity and strategic depth. Whereas the strongest chess programs can routinely defeat grandmasters, Go professionals can still get away with giving the best Go programs five to six stones' handicap. 	200	103
1017	The Basics of European Politics	European politics often finds itself in the news. From Brexit to Marine Le Pen, it's sometimes incredibly confusing to keep up with - even for those in Europe! We'll try and make sense of some of the basic concepts together, from the structure and role of the European Union to the role of individual nations and (maybe) understanding why the UK voted the way it did in 2016. Whether you're politics mad or just want to understand the news a little more, join us to make sense of Europe a little more.	25	103
1018	Acoustics and the Fourier Transform	The Fourier Transform is a tool for looking at the nature of waves and has applications in mathematics, physics, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, and other fields. However, it is most intuitive to understand when applied to sound. This class will review the physics of sound and introduce the Fourier Transform with examples from synthesizers and electronic music.	40	103
1019	Game Theory, Altruism, and Evolutionary Theory	If it's the "survival of the fittest," why does altruism exist? Why do <i>Homo sapiens</i> spend so much time and energy keeping track of other members of their species? And what does game theory have to do with any of this?	40	103
1020	Nature's Short Cut: Least Action Principles in Physics	Nature is smart. Nature knows how to take short cuts, doing things in the most efficient way. We'll talk about some of these short cuts in physics, such as Fermat's principle, the Lagrangian formulation of classical mechanics, and if time permits, Feynman's ingenious path integral recipe in quantum mechanics.	99	103

1022	The Wonderful World of Shoelaces	Believe it or not, there's more than just one way to lace up (and tie) the shoes on your feet. Want to learn to lace your shoes like straight bars, a spider-web, a starburst, a supernova, or a lattice? Want to learn how to tie your shoes so you'll (hopefully) never need to tie them again? Want to generally use your footwear to look like a boss? You'll see these methods and many more as you practice on your own shoes. Make a statement - use an awesome, unique lacing method (perhaps a different one on each shoe) with some colored (perhaps more than one color on each shoe) laces!	100	103
1023	Dumb Games	And we're here to bring you the worst of them. Join us for a hilarious 100 minutes of ridiculous role-playing and games. Including such beauties as the Obsessive Compulsive Disorder Support Group, Amnesia: The LARP,  and Football: The Musical.	24	103
1024	Let's Talk Community College	In this course, we will be talking about Community Colleges and how they can be utilized (or not) during your academic experience. For example, did you know you can take classes from Community Colleges for college credits while you are a high school student? We hope to do our best to address everyone's questions!	55	103
1025	Social Theory I:  A Cheese Plate of the Social Sciences	Have you ever been curious about what Marx actually said?  Have you wondered how the father of modern capitalism would feel about the economy of today?  Are you interested in Nietzsche, but unsure how to pronounce his name?  This class will briefly touch upon a variety of social theorists, giving enough of a taste to satisfy casual curiosity and hopefully to spur deeper explorations.	12	103
1026	Wheat and the Western Expansion: Funerals, Fungi, and Fungibility	We often think of the Midwest as having always been a part of the United States, but in fact, it's been settled less than two hundred years! A strange set of pressures forced Americans into the west despite Indians, war, and drought, and created the vast American nation we know today from a barren prairie that some had described as a desert. None of this settlement would have succeeded without a crop, and wheat was the right crop at the right time --- it could easily be transported and stored, and due to an amazing coincidence, wheat prices were high, disease was low, and technology had just made large-scale wheat growing possible when the West opened for settlement. Learn about the perils of the west, technological advances in farming, and the other factors that settled the West and gave rise to today's tractors and industrial farming	15	103
