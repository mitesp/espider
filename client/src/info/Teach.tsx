          Teaching for ESP can be an extremely rewarding and educational experience. It can also be
          as much or as little commitment as you like. If you would like to teach a one-time class,{" "}
          <a href="/splash">Splash</a> (in November) and <a href="/spark">Spark</a> (in early March)
          are great opportunities to teach about anything you want!
          <a href="/hssp"> HSSP</a> (spring and summer) is a 6–10 week program that gives you the
          opportunity to go more in-depth.
          <br /> <br />
          Moreover, we believe that teaching should be fun for you, as well as the students taking
          your classes. Our motto is{" "}
          <a href="/aboutus">“teach anything, learn anything, do anything”</a>
          , and we hope our programs allow you to teach the subjects (academic or non-academic) that
          you’re passionate about.
          <br /> <br />
          Teaching is also easier than you think! We can help you with advice, resources and helpful
          hints. You can teach a lecture class about programming algorithms, an interactive
          electronics class or maybe even teach yoga or martial arts. If you need resources for your
          class, you can either buy them (check with directors to determine your budget) or we can
          help you procure them. If you’d like advice or tips, check out our advice for teachers
          section, or simply contact us with any questions or thoughts.
