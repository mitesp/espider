            <b> About ESP </b> <br />
            The MIT Educational Studies Program (ESP) was created by MIT students in 1957 so we
            could make a difference in the Boston, Cambridge, and MIT communities by sharing our
            knowledge and creativity with local high school students. Since then, we have grown to
            support well over five thousand students each year with the help of MIT students like
            you.
            <br /> <br />
            ESP is a student group at MIT composed of undergraduate and graduate students. Members
            of ESP work to organize and run our many programs, supported by our teachers and
            volunteers. If you’re interested in getting involved behind-the-scenes, we invite you
            to come to our weekly meetings and worksessions. More information is available here.
            <br /> <br />
            Through an extensive offering of academic and non-academic classes, ESP is dedicated to
            providing a unique, affordable educational experience for motivated middle school and
            high school students. ESP courses are developed and taught by MIT students, alumni, and
            faculty, and members of the community.
            <br /> <br />
            Our students are given the chance to learn from passionate and knowledgeable teachers;
            our teachers can gain experience developing their own curricula with access to students
            with the strongest desire to learn. The result is a unique, dynamic curriculum and an
            atmosphere of unparalleled energy. We are the largest student-run program of our kind
            in the United States.
            <br /> <br />
            Our programs are guided by three main ideas:
            <br />
            <ol>
              <li>Learning and teaching should be fun!</li>
              <li>Participants should have as much choice as possible.</li>
              <li>Accessibility and equal access to educational opportunities for students is
                  important.</li>
            </ol>

            <b> Our Educational Mission </b> <br />
            The MIT Educational Studies Program (ESP) was created by MIT students in 1957 so we
            could make a difference in the community by sharing our knowledge and creativity with
            local high school students. Since then, we have grown to support well over three
            thousand students each year with the help of hundreds of MIT students. Our original
            <a href="/hssp"> High School Studies Program (HSSP)</a> has been joined by many other
            enrichment <a href="/programs">programs</a> over the years, and our agenda changes each
            year to best suit the community’s needs.
            <br /> <br />
            <b> More About ESP </b> <br />
            Through an extensive offering of academic and non-academic classes, ESP is dedicated to
            providing a unique, affordable educational experience for motivated middle school and
            high school students. ESP is a great activity for teens in the Boston area. ESP classes
            are developed and taught by MIT students, alumni, and faculty, and members of the
            community. Our students are given the chance to learn from passionate and knowledgeable
            teachers; our teachers can gain experience developing their own curricula with access
            to students with the strongest desire to learn. The result is a unique, dynamic
            curriculum and an atmosphere of unparalleled energy. We are the largest student-run
            program of our kind in the United States.
            <br /> <br />
            ESP invites students from all walks of life for classes varying from completely fun and
            non-academic (Duct Tape Design, Bottle Rockets) to the most advanced and challenging
            (Build Your Own Operating System, Quantum Mechanics) available to high school students.
            Our organization aims to provide exciting, thoughtful and meaningful classes for anyone
            with the desire to learn.
            <br /> <br />
            <b> Variety and Experimentation </b> <br />
            Teach Anything. Learn Anything. Do Anything. Really. No other student group puts on
            programs involving a thousand high school students. Being part of ESP is being part of
            one of the most unique organizations anywhere, an organization that is always filled
            with energy and new ideas — and isn’t afraid of trying those new ideas out. Coming to
            an ESP program means being a part of the cutting edge of education.
            <br /> <br />
            It is an astonishing thing to be a part of any ESP program as it happens, and it always
            feels wonderful when all the pieces fall into place. ESP invites all members of the MIT
            community and beyond to come to our office hours or meetings and learn more about our
            organization.
